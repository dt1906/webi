#First of all download an Arch linux iso from the official website

1.PREFERED THAT FIRST TIME YOU INSTALL IT OR PLAY WITH IT IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE.
2.ITS STRICTLY FOR EXPERIENCED USERS IF YOU DID A FUCK UP I AM NOT RESPONISBLE.
3.IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GO TO THE OFFICIAL ARCH WIKI AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND INSTALLATION.
4.YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THEN "I USE ARCH BTW".
#First Step To Hell
1.BOOT THROUGH THE ISO.
2.YOU WILL GET A PROMPT.
3.PING TO CHECK THE NETWORK IS U OR DOWN.
 ping www.google.com
 timedatectl set-ntp true
 lsblk ## To know the disk name and size.
 cfdisk
 make a 128M partition primary give it a boot flag and make the other partition primary of the remaining disk space
 and save changes and exit out of cfdisk.
 mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda1 && mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda2
 mkdir /mnt/boot
 mount the 128M boot partition to /mnt/boot
 mount the remaining space partition to /mnt
 
 mount /dev/vda2 /mnt 
 mount /dev/vda1 /mnt/boot
 genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
 pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware nano vim 
 arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash 
# NOW YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR ACTUAL INSTALL 
 
 pacman -S grub networkmanager
 systemctl enable NetworkManager
 nano /etc/locale.gen
 uncomment en-us utf and iso 
 locale-gen
 nano /etc/local 
 enter LANG=en-US.UTF-8
 close the file
 nano /etc/hostname 
 enter any name you want hostname is like arch@hostname so you can set it according to your desire.
 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Karachi /etc/localtime
 grub-install /dev/vda
 grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
#And very important 
 passwd
#NOW EXIT OUT OF THE BIN/BASH
umount -R /mnt 
reboot 
#NOW YOU HAVE A WORKING ARCH LINUX INSTALLED ENJOY THE FUCKIN OPERATING SYSTEM MAN CHILL OUT.

#IMPORTANT NOTE:If you like forgot to install a network manager or never changed the default root password you have done a serious fuck up.Heres how to solve this

1.ENTER THE BOOTABLE ARCH USB OR ATTACH ISO AS FIRST BOOT ON VIRTUAL MACHINE MANAGER.IF YOU ARE INSTALLING ARCH 
ATLEAST YOU HAVE TO KNOW THESE THINGS.
2.YOU WILL GET A RED PROMPT JUST LIKE THE INSTALLATION TIME.
3.NOW MOUNT YOUR PARTITION OF MAXIMUM SPACE.
mount /mnt /dev/vda2
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
4.NOW INSTALL THE REMAINING PACAKAGES OR ANY CONFIGURATION YOU WANT TO DO.

#FOR WIFI CONSULT ARCH-WIKI I USE ETHERNET.
